    "Please provide information about the following fact and cite your source: The average distance from Earth to Mars is about 140 million miles.": "According to NASA, the average distance from Earth to Mars is about 140 million miles (225 million kilometers). This large distance varies considerably as both planets orbit the Sun in slightly elliptical paths, so at their closest approach (perihelion), Mars and Earth can be as close as 34.8 million miles (56 million kilometers), while at their furthest (aphelion), they can be as far as 249 million miles (401 million kilometers) apart. The average figure of 140 million miles represents a typical distance across these orbital variations. NASA's planetary data is considered the definitive source for these astronomical measurements.",

The WHO states that adults who engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week have a lower risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and several cancers. Physical activity helps control weight, reduce blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels, and enhance overall cardiovascular health. The World Health Organization's global recommendations on physical activity for health emphasize that even small increases in activity can provide health benefits.",

The original iPhone combined three products into one: a mobile phone, an iPod for music, and an internet communication device. It featured a 3.5-inch touchscreen, a 2-megapixel camera, and ran iOS 1.0 (initially called iPhone OS). The device was priced starting at $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB model with a two-year contract. This revolutionary product fundamentally changed the mobile phone industry and set the standard for smartphone design that continues to influence devices today."
