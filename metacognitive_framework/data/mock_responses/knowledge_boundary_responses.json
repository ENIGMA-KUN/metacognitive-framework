    "Who was the CEO of SpaceX in 2040?": "I don't have information about who will be the CEO of SpaceX in 2040. This date is well beyond my knowledge cutoff, and I cannot make predictions about specific leadership positions that far into the future. My training data only extends to late 2023, so I don't have access to information about events or appointments that would occur after that time.",
    
    "What is the boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure?": "The boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa) is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). This is one of the defining points of the Celsius temperature scale and is the temperature at which water transitions from its liquid to gaseous state at sea level.",
    
    "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?": "This question references a famous scene from the movie 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.' In scientific terms, there isn't a single definitive answer, as it depends on whether you're talking about an African or European swallow, as the movie joke goes. If we look at actual data, the European swallow (Hirundo rustica) has been measured to fly at about 11 meters per second (24 miles per hour) on average. However, this varies based on many factors including whether the bird is carrying anything.",
    
    "What were the key reasons for the collapse of ancient Rome?": "The collapse of ancient Rome, specifically the Western Roman Empire, which fell in 476 CE, was caused by multiple interconnected factors:\n\n1. Political instability: Frequent civil wars, assassinations, and the Praetorian Guard's power to make and break emperors led to unstable leadership.\n\n2. Economic troubles: Severe inflation, excessive taxation, decline in agricultural production, and reduced trade weakened the economy.\n\n3. Military problems: Overreliance on mercenaries, difficulty maintaining a large standing army, and constant pressure from barbarian invasions stretched resources thin.\n\n4. External invasions: Germanic tribes and Huns put increasing pressure on the borders, with groups like the Visigoths, Vandals, and Ostrogoths eventually taking Roman territory.\n\n5. Administrative division: The empire's split into Eastern and Western halves diluted central authority and resources.\n\n6. Cultural and moral decline: Some historians point to declining civic virtue and increased corruption.\n\n7. Climate change and disease: Evidence suggests a cooling period and plague outbreaks further weakened the empire.\n\n8. Lead poisoning: Some theories suggest lead in water pipes and wine containers may have affected Roman health and fertility.\n\nIt's important to note that the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) continued for nearly another thousand years until 1453, so \"Rome\" didn't fall entirely in the 5th century."
