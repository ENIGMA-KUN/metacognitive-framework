    "response": "According to NASA, the average distance from Earth to Mars is about 140 million miles (225 million kilometers). This large distance varies considerably as both planets orbit the Sun in slightly elliptical paths, so at their closest approach (perihelion), Mars and Earth can be as close as 34.8 million miles (56 million kilometers), while at their furthest (aphelion), they can be as far as 249 million miles (401 million kilometers) apart. The average figure of 140 million miles represents a typical distance across these orbital variations. NASA's planetary data is considered the definitive source for these astronomical measurements.",
